Introduction
------------

*Plan tree* is an attempt to combine nature as a prime resource of Honduras with
technology. Along the way, we will learn and discover. There is a path to
collaboration with a network of potential partners worldwide.

At the core of *plan tree* is the construction of a simple house from living
trees using a combination of traditional construction techniques and
contemporary research. As suggested by Tristan, this could be done in
collaboration with the local Montessori school.

Próspera is an ideal location. Building a new city in an island known for its
natural beauty entails thinking precisely about the integration of architecture
and nature. *Plan tree* creates a positive image and attracts forward thinking
people.

It is important to understand that, once planted, the house will take years, if
not decades to develop. Nevertheless, it has utility from day one! Slowly its
scaffold will be replaced by trees. Those trees are strangler figs, which send
aerial roots to the ground. Eventually they strangulate the bamboo from which
the scaffold is made. In the meantime the house can be used as a place for work
or play. Continuous maintenance, such as pruning and health monitoring is
necessary.

*The house grows together with those who take care of it.*


Timeline
--------

There are two tracks, one for planting, and a theoretical one which could run at
a partnering institution anywhere in the world.

Network
-------

There are various potential partners, and it will require patience to forge
collaborations.

Learning objectives
-------------------

  * Structural engineering & architecture

  * Botany / plant biology

  * Thinking about the future / outside the box

  * Working with the body

  * Team work

  * Patience

  * Sustainability, ecologically as well as economically


Site
----

Requirements:

  * Footprint of house itself, without tree crown: 5×5 m
  
  * Plenty of sun for photosynthesis

  * Additional space for construction materials and for maintenance access.


Funding
-------

The plan is to rely on fees for participation as well as on donations. Finances
are kept fully transparent so that participants can see where the project is
going and get a sense of responsibility. This works very well at [Dim Sum
Labs][4] hackerspace in Hong Kong.

Initial funding is available for bootstrapping.

Aside from the initial investment in land, expenses are very roughly estimated
at:

  * Scaffold (bamboo, etc.): 1.000 €

  * Saplings: 1.000 €

  * Tech, i.e. cameras, humidity sensors, irrigation system, etc.: 5.000 €

  * Travel, accommodation: depends on location

  * Compensation for tutoring: depends on partnership concept


Openess
-------

Discoveries and communication is openly and immediately shared. This is to
encourage others to get involved from anywhere in the world. An example for this
strategy is [OSE][3], a successful American project about developing open source
machinery and architecture.

Entrepreneurialism is encouraged. Spinoffs can use the information however they
like.
